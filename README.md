# Kolor Kingdom
### A game made in HaxeFlixel

## Story

The evil MonoMalice has taken all the world's color, and you must restore it by going to all 5 color palaces.

## Mechanics (none of this stuff is actually in the game yet)

Press the buttons to activate things like secret doors or dropping a cube.

Every time you beat a color palace, you get a new ability that will be used in the other color palaces.

The color palaces are themed around their color
Example: Blue color palace is themed around water, yellow is themed around electricity, etc.
